        The Student Government Association is an organization that helps provide
        Rose-Hulman students with opportunities to be involved on campus in meaningful ways via leadership, club
        sponsoring, and the ability to make valuable changes to the Rose community. Thought the Executive Board, Senate,
        and Judiciary Board students are encouraged to become more active in the campus community through legislature
        changes, communicating the opinions of students on and off campus, and finding ways to better the Rose-Hulman
        campus.
