The primary way to get involved is to run for a senate or class president position. Elections for senators are done at the beginning of the year, while elections for class presidents are done at the end of the year. If you miss these elections, or don't get elected, and still want to be a senator, keep your eyes out because sometimes vacancies occur in the middle of the year.

If you are not a senator, you still can get involved.
